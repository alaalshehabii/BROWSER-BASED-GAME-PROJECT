‚öôÔ∏è Game Mechanics
Initialization
Set the player's initial position near the bottom of the canvas.
Generate an initial set of platforms positioned vertically.
Main Game Loop (per animation frame)
Physics and Movement
Apply gravity to the player‚Äôs vertical velocity.
Update player‚Äôs position according to velocity and horizontal input.
Scroll the viewport upward when the player reaches a vertical threshold.
Platform Handling
Draw all platforms relative to the current scroll offset.
Detect collision between player and platforms during descent; reset vertical velocity to simulate jump if collision occurs.
Platform Management
Generate new platforms above the visible screen as the player ascends.
Remove platforms that move below the visible screen.
Enemies and Obstacles
Detect collisions between player and enemies/obstacles.
Trigger game over or decrease player lives on collision.

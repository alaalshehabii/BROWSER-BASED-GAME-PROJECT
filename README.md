Game Flow and Mechanics
Initialization
Set the player's starting position near the bottom of the canvas.
Generate an initial set of platforms positioned vertically within the visible area.
Main Game Loop (runs every animation frame)
Physics and Movement
Apply gravity to the playerâ€™s vertical velocity.
Update the player's position based on current velocity and horizontal input from the user.
Scroll the screen upward when the player reaches a certain vertical threshold to simulate continuous climbing.
Platforms Handling
For each platform:
Draw the platform at its position adjusted for the current scroll offset.
Detect collision with the player while falling; if detected, reset the player's vertical velocity to simulate a jump.
Platform Management
Generate new platforms above the visible screen as the player climbs higher.
Remove platforms that have scrolled below the bottom of the screen to optimize performance.
Enemy and Obstacle Detection
Detect collisions between the player and enemies or obstacles.
If a collision occurs, trigger game over or reduce the player's life depending on game design.
Power-ups
Detect collection of power-ups by the player.
Apply power-up effects, such as temporary higher jumps or invincibility.
Score Update
Update and display the player's score based on the highest vertical position reached.
Win and Lose Conditions
Win Condition:
The player reaches a predefined target height or collects a specific number of power-ups (optional based on game design).
Alternatively, the game may be endless with the goal to achieve the highest possible score.
Lose Condition:
The player falls below the bottom of the screen (misses platforms).
The player collides with an enemy or hazardous obstacle (if implemented).
The player runs out of lives (if lives system is implemented).
Pseudocode Overview
Initialize game:
  set player position near bottom
  generate initial platforms

Game Loop:
  apply gravity to player velocity
  update player position based on velocity and input
  if player.y < scroll threshold:
    scroll screen upward

  for each platform:
    draw platform at adjusted position
    if player collides with platform while falling:
      player.velocityY = jump velocity

  generate new platforms above view as needed
  remove platforms below screen

  if player collides with enemy or obstacle:
    trigger game over or lose life

  if player collects power-up:
    apply power-up effect

  update score based on player height

Check game over:
  if player falls below screen bottom:
    end game and display score

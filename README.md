# 🚀 Space Hop  

---

## 🎮 Game Overview  
**Space Hop** is a vertical platform jumper inspired by *Doodle Jump*.  
You play as an astronaut bouncing higher and higher on platforms to avoid falling out of orbit.  

**Why I chose this game:**  
I’ve always liked retro space themes and wanted a fun arcade-style project to practice **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Watching others build similar games with HTML canvas inspired me to create my own unique version.

## 🌐 Getting Started  

- **Play the game here:** [Space Hop on GitHub Pages](https://alaalshehabii.github.io/Space-Hop/)  

- **Planning materials:**  
  Game idea, controls, and design choices were drafted from notes and references while following tutorials on **HTML Canvas** and building a **Doodle Jump clone**.
